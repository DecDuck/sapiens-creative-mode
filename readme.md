# Sapiens Creative mode

Introducing Creative Mode to the Sapiens experience! Fly as high as far as you like, instantly complete and build new structures, or grant your Sapiens skills. In general this mod transforms Sapiens from a survival god-game into a proper god-game.

`WARNING:` This mod is very much WIP, and is also being used to test the Hammerstone Framework. Some content is not yet implemented, or is intentionally in an annoying place.

## Cheat Menu

Shows up on world load. Will be moved into some other location soon, probably with a keybinding.
