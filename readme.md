# A cheat-menu Mod for Sapiens

This mod generally exists to test the capabilities of the Erectus Framework. I will be adding additional cheats and features as Erectus evolves.

`Note:` I'm only building this Mod because Sapiens doesn't have an in-built "Creative Mode". I'm not really a fan of cheating :)
